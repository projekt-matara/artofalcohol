A white zinfandel is a dry-mildly sweet wine. A harsh bitter-sweet scent greets the nostrils while balancing a warm-spice fragrance. 
It is made from the zinfandel wine grape, which has a bold and almost spicey lingering after taste. 
For fans of a wine that is less sweet; while carrying a bold and bitter character, 
you may enjoy with this wine with a semi spicey meal. 
A simple chipotle cheddar burger balances the pallet of wine zest and spice. 
An equally delectable food pairing, italian sausage with dirty rice and roasted peppers. 
If you are not feeling a full meal a great snack would be spicy hummus and chips. 
For summer, a tangy and sweet citrus such as oranges, tangerines, nectarines, and maybe even pineapple. 
I found this glass rather enjoyable and easy to sip.
