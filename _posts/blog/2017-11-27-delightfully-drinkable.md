This wine by no means is too harsh nor too strong, in fact I find it rather inviting and sweet.
For a wine to be so crisp, it goes down so smoothly and always leaves me wanting another sip.
I can easily see this wine being mixed with a holiday apple cider or served chilled with friends and family.
It is even appealing to the non wine drinkers I've come across.
Sam's club sells this wine and for a pretty affordable price, so if your seeking a new wine to
try and nothing too dry this is a real winner.
