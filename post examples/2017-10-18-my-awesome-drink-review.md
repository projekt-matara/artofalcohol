The soft aroma of this peach wine is great for summer and spring, if you are into that kinda thing. 
If you are looking for something sweet & different I highly recommend this wine. It's a hint of tart with a subtle sweetness yet; not dry by any means.
For new wine enthusiasts, it goes down very smooth. It is meant to be served as a table wine, however it can double as a dessert wine. 
For those who prefer chilled, frozen peaches will keep your wine chilled without deluding flavor. 
In fact, it might add a hint of extra tartness for your pallet pleasure.

As for meals, lemon chicken with asparagus pairs nicely or even smoked salmon with spaghetti squash.
Another fantastic meal addition would be turkey or quail.  
Red meats seems too harsh to really compliment the light and sweet of this wine.
With regards to snacking, I heartily recommend lightly salted cashews or the sharpness of cheddar cheese. Simply yum!
